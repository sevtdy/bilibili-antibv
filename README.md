Since Bilibli change video URL format from "avxxx" to "BVxxx", I used a GreasyFory script call [Bilibli AntiBV](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/398499-bilibili-antibv]) to convert the video id back.

But the script only works on video playback page, in my case, I usually copy URL from search page.
So this version of script cover that missing part.
